gpg-pass password manager

This is a rather simple password manager that uses gpg as the encryption
mechanism. This is done to solve a somewhat unique problem where we need
certain people to have access to certain passwords.

This code is currently highly experimental. It needs to be cleaned up quite
a bit, but I needed something fast.

Use:

To use this you'll need the pygpgme package installed (this is on Fedora,
I'm unsure about other distributions).

Create your "store" directory. You can then add passwords as such:

bress@bowser gpg-pass % ./set-password -s /tmp/store -r josh@bress.net
example.com
Adding example.com
Username: test-user
Password: 

This create a file that is a sha256 hash of the site name (this is so
nobody knows what your site names are).


To decrypt:

bress@bowser gpg-pass % ./get-password -s /tmp/store example.com
site: example.com
username: test-user
password: secret
